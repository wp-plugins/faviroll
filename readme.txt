= 0.4.8.2 =
* OPT: Code maintenance for WP 3.x

= 0.4.8.1 =
* FIX: Ooops, I've overlooked a little error in my code, made one test too less, "mea cupla". ;-) 

= 0.4.8 - Codename: "Dixie's fix" =
* CLN: Code Refactoring: Code structure completely rewritten, a lot of bugfixes and runtime optimation.<br />
* FEA: Implementation of Windows BMP processing. Some site using this image format which can't process by PHPs GD-Library.<br />
Until now these proprietary formats was (non optimal) passed by Faviroll.
* FIX: Some Sites deliver Favions larger 16x16 pixels and proprietary formats wasn't shrinked to 16x16.<br />(Issue Request from Dixie. Thanks for feedback, "Dix").<br />
I've found [http://phpthumb.sourceforge.net/](http://phpthumb.sourceforge.net/) to solve the issue.<br />
This superb library is able to convert Windows BMP icons up to 32 Bit to [GD image](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php) which Faviroll needs.<br />
Conclusion: Favicon handling is more complex I thought at the beginning, but I don't give up.

== Upgrade Notice ==
Nothing to do for you

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What's about favicons of https (SSL) Websites? =
 The plugin is 100% written in PHP. In PHP it isn't possible to decode SSL sites, so the plugin try to fallback to "[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)".
 If this is not available on your webserver, the favicon will not displayed.

= Where does the plugin come from? =
 see: [http://www.andurban.de/tag/faviroll](http://www.andurban.de/tag/faviroll)

= Can I save my custom favicons before install an update? =
  No, sorry.
  The cache directory is currently a subdirectory in the plugin directory, I designed this to hold all together.
  The wordpress update installer remove the whole old plugin directory before install the update, so all cached icons will removed, too.
