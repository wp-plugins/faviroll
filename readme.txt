Tags: favicons, links, icons, blogroll, bookmarks
Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 2.9.1, (WPMU 2.8.6)
Stable tag: 0.4.6

Locally caches all favicon.ico in PNG format and use this into the blogroll. Native ICO Images are not supported from all browsers (f.e. IE).

== Description ==

The plugin converts the favicon.ico from the blogroll links in PNG Image format and save the converted image locally. The conversion process works just on the admin-page, visitors don't have to waste time to wait for favicons from remote websites. If a blogroll entry was added or modified this single Link will be updated.

In a configured interval of dates will the favicon cache be refreshed, because the favicons from the remote site can be changed.

The plugin fallback on a default favicon, if on the remote websites cannot be detected a valid favicon. The default icon can be configured.

== Screenshots ==
1. Faviroll's outcome
